Minimum requirement: 
-- STS4 with Spring3 support library
-- PostgreSQL with PgAdmin 4
-- Postman API - to test the app

----------------------------------------------------

How to run:

1.Import project into STS4

2.Initialize a user in PostgreSQL with username: "postgres" and password: "9840"

3.Create a database called "monopolydb" in postgreSQL or execute the below command in SQL Shell

CREATE DATABASE monopolydb
    WITH
    OWNER = postgres
    ENCODING = 'UTF8'
    LC_COLLATE = 'English_India.1252'
    LC_CTYPE = 'English_India.1252'
    LOCALE_PROVIDER = 'libc'
    TABLESPACE = pg_default
    CONNECTION LIMIT = -1
    IS_TEMPLATE = False;

4.Once db is created start the Springboot app - configured in properties file to port 8080

5.Once the Springboot app is running, we can use services like Postman API to test our given commands
